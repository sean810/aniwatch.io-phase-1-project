## Description
Aniwatch.io!
Aniwatch.io is a web application that allows users to browse anime titles with features such as searching by title, filtering underrated animes, and toggling between dark and light modes. Anime titles are displayed in a grid layout with posters and brief descriptions for a user-friendly experience.
Aniwatch.io is different from other anime websites for it allows users to watch underatted animes by just clicking the "underrated animes" button instead of searching for the specific animes. The underrated animes are the animes that don't have a rating above 8.0, basically showing you that they have less ratings but are highly underrated by viewers.
How It Works!
Fetching Anime Data: The fetchAnimes() function retrieves anime data from a local API (http://localhost:3000/animes) and displays it dynamically in a grid format on the webpage.
Search by Title: The search feature allows users to filter the anime list by title. As you type, the results automatically update to match your query.
Underrated Animes: The "Underrated Animes" button filters and displays anime titles with a rating below 8.0.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: The "Toggle Dark/Light Mode" button switches the page between dark and light themes using CSS classes.
Responsive Grid Layout: Anime posters are displayed in a grid, ensuring an optimal layout across devices.
